Objects: 
  In Javascript object is real time entity. An Object is a collection of properties which is in the form of Key & Pair value's. 
 Syntax: 
        {
            property1: value1,
            property2: value2,
            ...............
            ...............
            property3: value3
        }
 2. An Objects it contain's any combination of primitive data types(number,string,Boolean,null, undefined) as well 
    as reference data types (Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
    The variables don't actually store the value).
 3. Property and value is separated by colon(:).
 4. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a 
    simple dot-notation/array of key string.
 5. The object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive.
     You can define a property by assigning it a value.
 6. Unassigned properties of an object are undefined (and not null).
 7. The way of Object form, 
    1. simple object - properties and values (key & value) which is present inside curly braces '{}'.
    2. list of object - properties and values (key & value) which is present inside square bracket [] with curly braces '{}'.


 Example: 
 let resume={
    personalInfo:{
        name: "Jayakannan.k",
        email: "jkannan98471@gmail.com",
        mobileno: 9842798471,
        gender: "male",
        Nationality: "Indian",
        Religion: "Hindu"
    },
    Eductions: ["SSLC","HSC","Diploma", "Engineering"],
    yearOfExperience: 11,
    skills:{
        techincal_stack:{
            programming_language:["Java", "J2EE","JavaScript"],
            frameworks:["SpringBoot","Apache Camel","Hibernate"],
            servers:["JBOSSFUSE","TOMCAT"]
        },
        operating_system:["window","redhat-linux"],

 Creating Object in JavaScript:
    1. By Object literal
    2. By Creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword).

1. Creating object By Object literal: 
    Syntax:
    variable_scope variable_name = { property1:value1, property2:value2, .... propertyN:valueN };

    Example:
        const employee={
            emp_id:"1",
            emp_name:"Jayakannan",
            role:"Software Engineer"
        };

2. Creating object By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
    Syntax:
    variable_scope variable_name = new Object();

    Example:
        const employee = new Object();
        employee.emp_id = 1;
        employee.emp_name ="Jayakannan";
        employee.role="Software Engineer";

Accessing JavaScript Object:
    The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:
    
    objectName.property
            or
    objectName[“property”]

    Example:
        employee.emp_name 
            or
        employee[emp_name]
